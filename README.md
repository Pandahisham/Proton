Proton
======

Beta release - August 2012

Proton is a declarative multitouch framework that allows developers to specify gestures as regular expressions of touch event symbols. Proton converts the touch events outputted by multitouch hardware into a stream of touch event symbols that encode the touch action (down, move, and up), touch ID (e.g., first touch, second touch, etc.) and custom touch attributes (e.g., touch hit-target, touch direction, etc.). Developers describe multitouch gestures as regular expressions of these symbols, which Proton matches against the touch event stream.

Proton is a C++ implementation based on the research papers:
